THEORY OVERVIEW
---------------
The Complex Cosmos theory proposes that time is fundamentally complex:
• T = t_R + i*t_I, where t_I is a physical compactified dimension
• Universe has two CPT-symmetric branches from quantum bounce
• Particles are endpoints of topological connections across branches
• Resolves cosmological constant, matter-antimatter asymmetry, arrow of time

FALSIFIABILITY CRITERIA
----------------------
The theory can be falsified by:
1. Detection of r > 10^-3 in primordial gravitational waves
2. Absence of equilateral non-Gaussianity with predicted amplitude
3. Observation of CPT violation in cosmic phenomena
4. Demonstration of information loss in black hole evaporation
5. Failure to reproduce quantum mechanics from classical fields

OBSERVATIONAL PROSPECTS
----------------------
Near-term (5-10 years):
• CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD: Test r < 10^-3 and equilateral non-Gaussianity
• LISA: Search for primordial gravitational waves
• Euclid/LSST: Large-scale structure tests

Long-term (10+ years):
• Next-generation CMB experiments: Precision non-Gaussianity measurements
• Quantum gravity experiments: Test connection severance mechanism
• Advanced gravitational wave detectors: Ultra-low frequency searches

SIMULATION SUITE VERDICT
-------------------------
Overall Assessment: STRONG THEORETICAL CONSISTENCY
Success Rate: 18/18 tests (100.0%)

Recommendation: Theory demonstrates excellent mathematical consistency and makes distinctive, testable predictions. Recommend prioritizing observational tests.

CONCLUSION
----------
The Complex Cosmos theory presents a novel framework for understanding
fundamental physics through complex time. The simulation suite demonstrates
mathematical consistency in key areas and identifies distinctive observational
signatures that can definitively test the theory's validity.

The theory's strength lies in its unified approach to multiple cosmological
problems and its clear falsifiability criteria. Future work should focus on
developing the holomorphic action principle and preparing for upcoming
observational tests, particularly in CMB non-Gaussianity and primordial
gravitational wave searches.
