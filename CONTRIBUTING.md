## Contribution Guidelines

### Code Standards

1. **Python Style**
   - Follow PEP 8 guidelines
   - Use `black` for code formatting
   - Use `isort` for import sorting
   - Maximum line length: 127 characters

2. **Documentation**

   - Provide physical interpretation where relevant
   - Use type hints for function signatures

3. **Testing**
   - Write tests for all new functionality
   - Maintain >80% code coverage
   - Include both unit tests and integration tests

### Scientific Standards

1. **Mathematical Rigor**
   - Provide complete derivations for new results
   - Clearly state assumptions and approximations
   - Include stability and consistency checks
   - Reference relevant literature

2. **Observational Claims**
   - Use actual experimental data, not simulated values
   - Include proper error analysis
   - State confidence levels explicitly
   - Avoid overstated significance claims

3. **Reproducibility**
   - Document all parameters and random seeds
   - Provide clear instructions for reproduction
   - Include data sources and processing steps

### Addressing Current Issues

The theory currently has several known limitations. Contributions addressing these are particularly valuable:

#### High Priority Issues

1. **Bounce Stability** ([Issue #1](https://github.com/mbhatt/complexcosmos/issues/1))
   - Current bounce mechanism shows instabilities
   - Need rigorous stability analysis
   - Explore alternative formulations

2. **Î›CDM Transition** ([Issue #2](https://github.com/mbhatt/complexcosmos/issues/2))
   - Mechanism for post-bounce evolution unclear
   - Need explicit connection to standard cosmology
   - Address fine-tuning concerns

3. **Holomorphic Action** ([Issue #3](https://github.com/mbhatt/complexcosmos/issues/3))
   - 5D action principle needs rigorous formulation
   - Kaluza-Klein reduction requires careful treatment
   - Ghost/tachyon analysis incomplete

4. **Observational Validation** ([Issue #4](https://github.com/mbhatt/complexcosmos/issues/4))
   - Replace self-validation with external data comparison
   - Implement proper statistical tests
   - Address overstated detection claims

#### Medium Priority Issues

5. **Quantization Scheme** ([Issue #5](https://github.com/mbhatt/complexcosmos/issues/5))
6. **Information Paradox Details** ([Issue #6](https://github.com/mbhatt/complexcosmos/issues/6))
7. **Dark Matter Mechanism** ([Issue #7](https://github.com/mbhatt/complexcosmos/issues/7))
8. **Experimental Proposals** ([Issue #8](https://github.com/mbhatt/complexcosmos/issues/8))
